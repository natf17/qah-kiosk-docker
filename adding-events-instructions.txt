|  Adding events to the kiosk CMS  |
------------------------------------

The instructions below assume that you are provided with a list of events for a particular event type (REG, CACO, or CABR) for a single service year.

1. Go to the Strapi admin panel.

2. Determine the service year for the events that will be entered:
 - service_year = REGIONAL CONVENTION dates' year OR
 - service_year = earliest CIRCUIT ASSEMBLY dates' year + 1

3. If you are adding dates for an event season that already exists, skip to step 6.

4. Create an Event Season:
 - if a REGIONAL CONVENTION:
   - Type: REG
   - DurationDays: 3
   - ServiceYear: [enter service_year calculated in step 2]
   - SeasonYears:
   - en:
       - Theme: [enter regional convention theme]
       - DurationText: "Three days"
   - es:
       - Theme: [enter regional convention theme]
       - DurationText: "Tres dias"
 - if a CIRCUIT ASSEMBLY:
   - Type: CACO (if with CO) or CABR (if with branch rep.)
   - DurationDays: 1
   - ServiceYear: [enter service_year calculated in step 2]
   - SeasonYears:
   - en:
       - Theme: [enter circuit assembly theme]
       - DurationText: "Un dia"
   - es:
       - Theme: [enter circuit assembly theme]
       - DurationText: "Un dia"

5. Save and publish.

6. For each event, create a Seasonal Event.
   - Seasonal Type: [should match that of corresponding event season]
   - StartDate: [day of event, or first day if a regional convention]
   - EventLanguage: [choose the language of the assembly/convention: english (en), spanish (es), italian (it), polish (pl, korean (ko)]
